/*
This program converts an original input of either temperature or distance in a certain unit type to the desired temperature or distance in a different unit type

We first ask the user for their first input (to convert temperature or distance)
We then ask the user for their second input (the temperature or distance with the original unit that will later be converted)
We then ask the user for their third and final input (the temperature or distance into the unit they want it to be converted in)

if the user does not ever provide a right input, we check why that input is wrong and display an error message
